## Betsu means 'separately'

Experienced complication when you shared your discounted meal with your friends and it's hard to calculate who pay which prices? That's this project come to help!

Betsu means 'separately' in Japanese and used when people want to pay the price separately, so I use this word for uniqueness of the repo name lol. 

This project built on React 16.8.1 with simple funtional component and React Hooks.  Feel free to see the code!
